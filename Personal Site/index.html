    <h1>Jaimie Barnes</h1>
    <p>PhD Candidate at the <em>University of Exeter</em></p>
    <p>I study a PhD on <strong>Insecticide Detoxification in Key Pollinator Hoverfly Guilds</strong>. I 
        am fascinated by arthropods, especially insects and arachnids. Spiders are my favourite animals and
        I hope to be able to carry forward  my research to study them in a fruitful career.</p>

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I completed an integrated <em>Masters in Zoology</em> with a <strong>1st Class</strong>. Beyond
        that there isn't really anything interesting education-wise that is relevant. Everything else 
        prior to my degree is irrelevant but here is my education history.</p>

    <p>Spiders are my favourite and I have included some Peacock spiders here. The first one is called
        <em>Maratus nimbus</em>.

    <p>Here is the final peacock spider, this time the file is called from an image folder made within

    <p>The spider is called <em>Maratus clupeatus</em></p>
